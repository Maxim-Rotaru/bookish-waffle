Once upon a time,
there was a mean vegatable
he was so strong and mighty
so big so huge so not human
but one day a human came across this vegatable
the vegetable showed just how strong and mighty he was
how big and how huge he was
the human found him beautiful
the human gave him a hug
hug so big he fell in love
when he eventually found his way home
he told everyone
this is why everyone loves vegatables
