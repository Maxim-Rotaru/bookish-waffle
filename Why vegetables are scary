Once upon a time,
there was a mean vegatable
he was so strong and mighty
so big so huge so not human
but one day a human came across this vegatable
the vegetable showed just how strong and mighty he was
how big and how huge he was
the human found him beautiful
the human gave him a hug
hug so big he fell in love
when he eventually found his way home
he told everyone
this is why everyone loves vegatables

Second story:

this is why everyone fears vegatables
but the story does not end there
this vegatable discided one day to visit a city
the people saw and feared for their lives
even the police were running from the all mightly vegatable
So scared the governemnt ended up bombing the city
ending up ending everyone but the all mightly one and only vegetable
