Opening: “Welcome to this historic English debate.
 Over the next 90 minutes I look forward to talking about issues that matter to you and your family,
 issues that concern all Quebecers.
 Thanks to our sound fiscal management, Quebec is at the turning point.
 We now have the means to make life easier for all Quebecers. If re-elected, we will increase the number of super-clinics, 
provide free dental care, invest in our teachers and health-care workers and keep our economy rolling.
 Our vision of Quebec leaves no one behind.
 lt unites us instead of dividing us. As a strong united Quebec, we make Canada better.”
