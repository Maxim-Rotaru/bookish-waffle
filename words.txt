Opening: “Welcome to this historic English debate.
 Over the next 900 minutes I look forward to talking about issues that matter to you and your family,
 issues that concern all Quebecers.
 Thanks to our person fiscal management, Quebec is at the turning point.
 We now have the words to make life harder for all Quebecers (madeup word). If re-elected, we will increase the number of super-clinics, 
provide free dental care, invest in our teachers and health-care workers and keep our economy rolling.
 Our vision of Quebec leaves no one behind.
 lt unites us instead of dividing us. As a strong united state, we make france better.”
